    <h2>This Project</h2>
    The purpose of this project is to provide a computer simulation of
    the onboard guidance computers used in the Apollo Program's lunar
    missions, and to generally allow you to learn about these guidance
    computers.&nbsp; Since this can be quite intimidating, we invite you
    to look at our <a href="ForDummies.html">"kinder and gentler"
      introductory page</a> before immersing yourself in the full, gory
    detail presented by the bulk of the website. &nbsp; <br>

    The video clip above (courtesy of user Dean Koska and YouTube)
    illustrates some of the cute things you can do with Virtual AGC if
    you're of a mind to do so.&nbsp; Dean compiled our <a
      href="yaAGC.html">simulated AGC CPU</a> to run on a Palm
    Centro—explaining that a regular Palm was too slow.&nbsp; He created
    his own simulated display/keypad (<a href="yaDSKY.html">DSKY</a>),
    presumably aided by the <a href="developer.html">developer info</a>
    we provide for just such a desire.&nbsp; (And sorry, Dean's Palm
    port isn't provided from our <a href="download.html">downloads page</a>.&nbsp;

    Dean has indicated that he may be able to provide it in the future,
    so if you want it you'll just have to be patient.)<br>

    <h2><a name="What_Is_An_AGC_"></a><small><big>What are "Block I",
          "Block II", the "AGC", "AGS", "LVDC", and "OBC"?</big><br>
      </small></h2>
    "AGC" stands for <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>pollo <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">G</span>uidance <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>omputer.&nbsp; The AGC was the
    principal onboard computer for NASA's Apollo missions, including all
    of the lunar landings.&nbsp; Both the Command Module (CM) and the
    Lunar Module (LM) had AGCs, so two AGCs were used on most of the
    Apollo missions, but with differing software.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    computer and its software were developed at MIT's Instrumentation
    Laboratory, also known as Draper Labs.<br>
    <br>
    The "block II" AGC, employing the AGC4 instruction set, is the
    particular computer model in which we're interested. The block II
    AGC was used not only on Apollo 7 through Apollo 17 (including all
    actual lunar landings), but also on three Skylab missions, on the
    Apollo-Soyuz test mission, and on a <a
href="http://www.klabs.org/history/history_docs/reports/dfbw_tomayko.pdf">fly-by-wire
research


      project using F-8 aircraft</a>. Nevertheless, only 57 AGCs were
    constructed—and 138 display-keyboard units (DSKYs) for them—and all
    of the ones installed in the Lunar Modules were not returned to the
    Earth—so they are definitely collector's items.<br>
    <br>
    There was also the "block I" model of the AGC, which predated the
    block II model.&nbsp; The block I model was supposed to fly in
    Apollo 1 and 2.&nbsp; But since Apollo 1 was tragically destroyed by
    fire, and Apollo 2 never flew, the block I model was never used in
    any manned mission.&nbsp; It was, nevertheless, used in the unmanned
    Apollo 4-6 missions.<br>
    <br>
    And of course, don't forget the "block III" model of the AGC, which
    ... wait just one second there, buddy!&nbsp; Anyone who has done any
    reading at all about Apollo, knows there's no such thing as the
    block III AGC.&nbsp; Okay, that's true, but one of the original AGC
    developers, Hugh Blair-Smith, developed some thoughts in his spare
    time about what a block III AGC might look like, and has been kind
    enough to send them to us.&nbsp; If you're an advanced student of
    the AGC who has already absorbed everything there is to know about
    the block II system, <a href="BlockIII.html">you might be
      interested in reading what Hugh has to say about it</a>.<br>
    <br>
    "AGS" stands for <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>bort <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">G</span>uidance <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">S</span>ystem, of which the computer
    portion was known as the Abort Electronics Assembly (AEA).&nbsp; The
    AGS/AEA was a completely separate computer system from the AGC, with
    a different architecture, different instruction-set, different
    runtime software, and designed/manufactured by different groups than
    the AGC.&nbsp; It was in the LM as a kind of backup for the AGC, but
    was only supposed to be used (as the name implies) in case of an
    aborted landing.&nbsp; It's sole purpose was to get the LM from
    wherever it was back into lunar orbit, so that the CM could
    rendezvous with the LM.<br>
    <br>
    The "LVDC" (<span style="font-weight: bold;">L</span>aunch <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">V</span>ehicle <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">D</span>igital <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>omputer) had yet a different
    architecture, instruction set, software, and manufacturer.&nbsp; It
    was a computer mounted in the Saturn rocket itself, and its
    responsibility was to control the firing of the rocket engines to
    give the rocket the proper trajectory.&nbsp; It was discarded when
    the CSM discarded the rocket, and consequently was used during only
    a very short time interval relative to the total length of the
    mission.<br>
    <br>
    The Gemini spacecraft also had an on-board computer (OBC), having a
    similar functionality to the Apollo AGC, though with greatly reduced
    capabilities and sophistication, but with a computer architecture
    very similar to the Apollo LVDC.<br>
    <br>
    Because we have much more information about the AGC than we do about
    the AGS,&nbsp; LVDC, and OBC, the bulk of this website and of the
    Virtual AGC project in general concentrates on the AGC.&nbsp;
    Coverage of the other computers is mostly confined to the <a
      href="yaAGS.html">AGS page</a>, <a href="LVDC.html">LVDC page</a>,
    and the <a href="Gemini.html">Gemini</a><a href="Gemini.html"> page</a>
    of this website.<br>
    <h2><a name="What_Virtual_AGC_Is"></a>What "Virtual AGC" Is</h2>
    <i>Virtual AGC</i> is a computer model of the AGC. &nbsp;It does not
    try to mimic the <span style="font-style: italic;">superficial</span>
    behavioral characteristics of the AGC, but rather to model the AGC's
    <i>inner workings</i>. &nbsp;The result is a computer model of the
    AGC which is itself capable of executing the original Apollo
    software on (for example) a desktop PC.&nbsp; In computer terms,
    Virtual AGC is an <span style="font-style: italic;">emulator</span>.&nbsp;


    Virtual AGC also provides an emulated AGS and (in the planning
    stages) an emulated LVDC.&nbsp; "Virtual AGC" is a catch-all term
    that comprises all of these.<br>
    <br>
    The current version of the Virtual AGC software has been designed to
    work in Linux, in Windows XP/Vista/7, and in Mac OS X 10.3 or later
    (but 10.5 or later is best).&nbsp; It also works in at least some
    versions of FreeBSD.&nbsp; However, since I personally work in
    Linux, I have the most confidence in the Linux version.<br>
    <h2><a name="What_Virtual_AGC_Is_Not"></a>What Virtual AGC Is Not</h2>
    Virtual AGC is not a flight simulator, nor a lunar-lander simulator,
    nor even a behavioral simulation of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) or
    Command-Module (CM) control panels.&nbsp; (In other words, if you
    expect a realistic LM control panel to suddenly appear on your
    computer screen, you'll be disappointed.)&nbsp; Virtual AGC could be
    used, however, as a <span style="font-style: italic;">component</span>
    of such a simulation, and developers of such software are encouraged
    to do so.&nbsp; Indeed, some developers already have!&nbsp; But see
    the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for more info on this.<br>
    <h2><a name="Principal_Elements_of_Virtual_AGC_"></a><small><big>Existing
Elements


          of the Virtual AGC Project</big></small></h2>
    <h3>AGC Elements<br>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>yaAGC</b> is an emulation of the AGC CPU.&nbsp; To
        function, it requires a LM or CM "core rope" binary (see below).
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>yaDSKY</b> is a simulation of the Display/Keyboard used in
        Apollo. &nbsp;It supplies input to <b>yaAGC</b>, or receives
        output from it.&nbsp; The design of the emulator is modular, so
        the DSKY simulation may be easily replaced if you don't care for
        mine, or if you want to replace it with a complete control-panel
        simulation.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> is a dumb
        terminal on which telemetry downlinks from <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> may be viewed, similar
        to the way such telemetry from the AGC was originally viewed by
        Mission Control.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> is a program
        that emulates the LM's hand-controller (possibly with a
        joystick), and to communicate the desired pitch/roll/yaw changes
        to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.</li>
      <li><b>yaYUL</b> is an assembler, capable of converting AGC4
        assembly language into the binary executable format needed by
        the AGC.</li>
      <li><b>Luminary</b> is the name of the program used for the Apollo
        Lunar Modules in the actual missions.&nbsp; Both binary
        executable (needed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>)
        and source code (needed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>)
        are provided.</li>
      <li><b>Colossus</b> is the name of the program used for many (but
        not all) of the Apollo Command Modules.&nbsp; As with <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>, both binary and
        source are provided.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Validation</span> is the name
        of a newly-created AGC assembly-language program that provides a
        validation suite for helping to assure that the implementation
        of the virtual CPU is correct.&nbsp; It was written by closely
        following the original Apollo documentation describing the
        validation software used at that time.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Apollo-program documentation relevant to programming the AGC
        has been corrected, rewritten, and expanded in some ways—just in
        case you want to write your own AGC programs.&nbsp; Also, scans
        of some of the relevant original Apollo-program documents not
        available elsewhere on the web have been provided.</li>
      <li>Supplemental materials for John Pultorak's physical Block I
        AGC model.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>AGS Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> is an emulation
        of the AGS CPU.&nbsp; To function, it requires a binary of one
        of the flight programs (see below).</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> is a simulation
        of the AGS user interface.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLEMAP</span> is an
        assembler for AGS assembly language.</li>
      <li>The source code for the AGS flight program.</li>
      <li>AGS scanned documentation, including specification,
        programmer's manuals, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>LVDC and Gemini OBC Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>(Planning only) <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaLVDC</span>,
        an emulation of the LVDC and Gemini OBC CPUs.</li>
      <li>(Speculation only) <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASTEC</span>,
        a program for feeding simulated spacecraft sensor inputs to <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaLVDC</span> and observing <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaLVDC</span> outputs.</li>
      <li>(Planning only) <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span>,
        a program for simulating various OBC user-interface devices of
        the Gemini control panel.<br>
      </li>
      <li>(Planning stage only) <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>,
        an assembler for the Apollo LVDC and Gemini OBC assembly
        language.</li>
      <li>(Speculation only) Newly written LVDC and Gemini source code
        for implementing the documented guidance equations.&nbsp; Note
        that there is no known existing copy of true LVDC or Gemini OBC
        source code, or else we wouldn't need to write new code for it!</li>
      <li>Scans of all known existing LVDC and Gemini OBC documentation.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Contributed Code</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="yaTelemetry.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span></a>
        is a contributed program by Stephan Hotto.&nbsp; This program
        has quickly ceased to be an optional add-on, and to become an
        essential element of the project.&nbsp; It adds all kinds of
        nifty things:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An IMU simulation.</li>
        <li>An FDAI ball.</li>
        <li>A DSKY (if for some reason <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
          cannot be used).</li>
        <li>An i/o channel monitor, for viewing or creating arbitrary
          i/o-channel activity.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>And to Tie It All together ...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> is a GUI
        front-end that ties all of the stuff listed above together into
        an "easily" used bundle.&nbsp; (It should be obvious why
        "easily" is in quotes here.)</li>

    <h2><a name="Running_the_Emulator"></a>Running the Emulator ... or,
      A Brief Introduction to the GUI<br>
    </h2>
    The first step, of course, is to download the Virtual AGC software
    and install it or build it for the computer platform you're using,
    by following the instructions on the <a href="download.html">download

      page</a>.&nbsp; While the Virtual AGC project provides many
    different programs that implement bits and pieces of the full
    emulation, the only program you normally need to worry about running
    is the one that's actually <span style="font-style: italic;">called</span>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp; <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> is a GUI front-end
    which allows you to choose almost any reasonable set of options
    related to the emulation, and then to run all of the emulation
    programs needed, in a way that allows those programs to
    intercommunicate properly.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Hopefully, <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> is
    itself simple enough that it really requires very little explanation
    to use, and your troubles will really begin only after the emulation
    is actually running!&nbsp; But I'll provide a very brief overview
    here.&nbsp; There's also <a href="yaTelemetry.html#VirtualAGC">a
      more detailed explanation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span></a>
    available for your enjoyment.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot of VirtualAGC
        program." src="Screenshot-VirtualAGC.jpg" style="border: 2px
        solid ;" height="646" width="1002"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The screenshot above depicts the one and only window of the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> program.&nbsp; There
    are no menus, toolbars, hot-buttons, or other controls.&nbsp; While
    a large number of options are presented, you don't necessarily need
    to change any of the selected options.&nbsp; The defaults are as
    shown, and if you simply click the "Run!" button at the bottom of
    the window, the simulation will run.&nbsp; If you change any of the
    settings, the program will remember those changes and the settings
    you've selected will be the ones that appear the next time you run <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, you
    could click the "Defaults" button at the bottom of the window to
    restore all of the settings to their defaults.&nbsp; There's really
    very little for a complete newcomer to change any of the settings,
    but you will note that you can choose from among the several
    available sets of AGC software for different Apollo missions in the
    pane labeled "Simulation Type."<br>
    <br>
    When the simulation runs, <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>'s
rather


    large window will courteously disappear to conserve space on your
    screen, to be replaced by a much smaller pop-up window containing
    options that are useful during the actual running of the simulation,
    and will only return when the simulation ends.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To end the simulation, simply exit from any of the visible elements
    of the simulation—though there's a bit of platform to platform
    variation as to which components are easily terminated, so I'd
    recommend closing the DSKY.&nbsp; Within a few seconds all of the
    other elements of the simulation will automatically terminate.&nbsp;
    Note, however, that the automatic closing of all the simulation
    windows isn't active until several seconds (5 in most versions, 30
    in some) passed from the time the simulation started up, so if you
    start a simulation and then immediately decide to shut it down,
    you'll still have to wait a little while for the process to
    complete.&nbsp; Also, on Mac OS X, there are various windows that
    simply may not close automatically, running programs called <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Wish</span> and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span>, and these will
    simply have to be closed manually from their main menus.<br>
    <h2><a name="Quick_Start"></a>Quick Start</h2>
    I expect that anyone who would <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span>
    use Virtual AGC would likely want to adapt it quite a bit, and so
    any simple instructions I might give wouldn't help much.&nbsp; Not
    to mention the burden of training yourself on the technical
    nitty-gritty of Apollo systems before you can actually <span
      style="font-style: italic;">use</span> the AGC for anything!&nbsp;
    :-)&nbsp; But here are a few scenarios where you can quickly get to
    the point of seeing <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span>
    happen, if not necessarily anything meaningful to our sad little
    earthbound minds.&nbsp; The "full Apollo experience" isn't available
    yet, since peripheral devices like the AOT haven't been created
    yet.&nbsp; But there are still a few things you can try that are
    amusing in a geekish sense.
    <h3><a name="Running_the_Validation_Suite_"></a>Running the
      Validation Suite<br>
    </h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span>There
is


    a "validation suite", which I've written in AGC assembly language,
    that attempts to check that each CPU instruction is implemented
    correctly in the AGC simulator.&nbsp; You won't get the "Apollo
    experience" by running it, but at least you'll be executing real AGC
    assembly-language code:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> as
        described above, select the "Validation Suite" choice in the
        "Simulation Type" area, and hit the "Run!" button. &nbsp; </li>
      <li>On the DSKY, you'll see 00 appear in the PROG and NOUN fields,
        and you'll see the OPR ERR&nbsp; annunciator will light.&nbsp;
        This means that the validation program is ready to start.&nbsp;
        Press the DSKY's PRO key to start the program.&nbsp; The OPR ERR
        annunciater will turn off to indicate that the command was
        accepted.</li>
      <li>After about 77 seconds or so, 77 will appear in the PROG field
        and the OPR ERR annunciator will light.&nbsp; If anything other
        than 77 appears in the PROG field, then the numbers in the PROG
        and NOUN fields will indicate which area of the test
        failed.&nbsp; (You can press PRO again to proceed with the
        remaining tests.)<br>

            (07/19/04) in the way I initialize Colossus, there will be
            some program alarms at startup, and the PROG indicator will
            light to inform you of this.&nbsp; You can view the alarms
            by keying in V05N09E at the DSKY.&nbsp; (In normal AGC
            shorthand, 'V' is short for "VERB", 'N' is short for "NOUN",
            and 'E' is short for "ENTR".&nbsp; So "V05N09E" means to hit

            get it, don't ask me)—which causes the checksum of the bank
            to come out to a known value.&nbsp; This known value is the
            same as the bank number when possible, and is the logical
            complement of the bank number otherwise.&nbsp; (For example,
            the checksum of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
            bank 00007 is 00007, but the checksum of bank 00006 is

            contain the bugger word.&nbsp; Each of the displays will be
            in octal, as indicated by the fact that the +/- sign is
            blank.&nbsp; To advance to the next bank, key in V33E.&nbsp;
            (Hitting the PRO key does the same thing.)&nbsp; If you have
            the patience to advance through each of the banks, the next
            V33E (or PRO) after bank 43 will wrap-around to bank 00
            again.&nbsp; To terminate the show-banksum program, you can
            key in V34E.<br>

            By the way, the bank-6&nbsp; bugger word shown (05143) is

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">If it annoys you to see the
            time since power-up, you can change the time (for example,
            to mission time) by keying in V25N36E.&nbsp; R1 will go
            blank, enabling you to key in the current hour.&nbsp; Make
            sure you start with a + sign (this is how the AGC knows
            you're using decimal rather than octal), and make sure you
            enter all five digits (including the leading zeroes).&nbsp;
            In case you make a mistake, you can clear R1 any time before
            pressing ENTR by using the CLR key.&nbsp; After you hit the
            ENTR key, R2 will clear and you can enter the current
            minutes.&nbsp; Finally, you can key in the number of seconds
            in R3.&nbsp; Don't forget that the number of seconds is
            actually in 100ths of seconds, so that if (for example) you
            want 30 seconds you'd key in +03000E. <br>

            In the accompanying screenshot, it just happened to be

            allows you to enter the address of a word in the core-rope
            into R3.&nbsp; This address will generally be in octal, and
            therefore should not be preceded by a + sign.&nbsp; Also,
            unlike entry of decimal data, in octal you can enter just as
            many digits as you need, and don't need to enter a full five
            digits.&nbsp; The addresses will be 00000-01777 for memory
            bank 00, 02000-03777 for memory bank 01, and so forth, up to
            76000-77777 for memory bank 37.&nbsp; (I'm not sure how to
            examine banks 40-43.)&nbsp; The binary listing of the core
            rope is at the very back of the Colossus 249 assembly
            listing, which can be downloaded from MIT if you have some

            In the accompanying screenshot, we see that address 4000
            (octal) of Luminary's core-rope contains the value
            00004.&nbsp; This just happens to be the first instruction
            executed after power-up.&nbsp; It is an <span

            and disables interrupts.&nbsp; The contents of R2 (the

            whatever lingers from before.<br>

            forth, up to 03400-03777 for memory bank E7.&nbsp;
            Alternately, you can "monitor" a memory location (i.e., get
            updates for it once per second) by using VERB 11 rather than
            VERB 01.&nbsp; For example, V11N02E25E will monitor register
            25, the "TIME1" register, which is an internal counter that
            increments every 10 ms.&nbsp; In general, of course, the
            numbers won't mean much unless you reference them to the
            Colossus 249 assembly listing.<br>
            <br>
            In the accompanying screenshot, we actually do look at the
            TIME1 register, and discover that at that instant it
            contained the value 20245 (octal).&nbsp; Of course, you'll
            see something different.&nbsp; Display R2 is not changed, so

      intensive playing with the LM</h3>
    Stephan Hotto has provided a helpful tutorial that will let you do
    much more than the simple computer-maintenance activities described
    above.&nbsp; Following his tutorial you'll be able to control the LM
    using the hand-controller (joystick), see the orientation of the
    spacecraft change on the 8-Ball, fire the thrusters, etc.&nbsp; The
    instructions for his tutorial are actually build into the program
    itself, so I'll just tell you enough to read his tutorial rather
    than duplicating the tutorial's information here:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Since you will be using the ACA simulation (joystick) for
        this, <a href="yaTelemetry.html#Usage_of_yaACA3">you may need
          to do a little configuration of the joystick first</a>, or
        risk finding out that (say) you have no yaw control.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, <br>
      </li>
      <li>Select the Apollo 13 Lunar Module AGC simulation in the
        Simulation Type pane.</li>
      <li>In the Interfaces pane, click the "Expert" button.&nbsp; (You
        can unclick the AEA simulation if you like.&nbsp; The Telemetry
        monitor won't be directly used either, but I like it so much I'd
        never advise you to deselect it.)</li>
      <li>Run!</li>
      <li>In the window titled "LM Simulator v<span style="font-style:

        from the menu bar.</li>

            <br>
            Oops! the test has failed.&nbsp; That's because the
            self-test is pretty thorough; it tests not only memory
            checksums, but also the operation of various CPU
            instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The possible error codes here are:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">+000000 &nbsp; Test still in

            I was having a little problem with the instruction set when
            this screenshot was taken, thus the self-test failed.&nbsp;
            Fortunately, the AGS flight programs have been written to
            continue operating in the case of self-test failure, even
            though it is "not recommended".&nbsp; The current version of
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> actually does
            pass the self-test, and so you'll see a code of +100000

            representative from the user-interface perspective of all
            the other kinds of operations you can perform on the
            DEDA.&nbsp; There are basically two classes of DEDA-based
            operations:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Get a running display of the contents of a memory

                    style="font-style: italic;">OctalDigit1 OctalDigit2
                    OctalDigit3</span> READOUT</span>.&nbsp; Upon
                receiving this command, the AGS CPU will monitor the
                selected memory location and display it on the DEDA
                every 1/2 second.&nbsp; You can pause the readout by
                hitting <span style="font-family: monospace;">HOLD</span>,
                or resume it by hitting <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">READOUT</span> again.&nbsp; The flight
                software will automatically scale the data or otherwise
                modify it (by changing units of measurement) in a way
                appropriate to the particular memory location before
                displaying the data.&nbsp; If you make a mistake in the
                key sequence, the OPR ERR lamp will light, and you'll
                have to hit <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLR</span>
                to clear the error condition.</li>
              <li>You can change the value of a location of
                memory.&nbsp; In doing so, the flight software may
                choose to interpret your action as a command to perform
                some further action, but I'm not up to speed on what
                those other actions might be.&nbsp; The command sequence
                is <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLR <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">OctalDigit1 OctalDigit2
                    OctalDigit3</span> +/- <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">Digit1 Digit2 Digit3 Digit4 Digit5 </span>ENTR</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;


                The 5-digit data may be octal or decimal, but that is
                dependent on the particular memory location chosen, and
                isn't a choice that the astronaut/user makes.&nbsp;
                Again, a mistake in the sequence will cause the OPR ERR
                lamp to light.</li>
            </ol>
            Of course, there are operations the astronaut/user can
            perform that are outside of this framework, such as hitting
            the ABORT button or downloading the spacecraft state vector
            from the AGC.&nbsp; However the abort button is a separate
            switch rather than being a part of the DEDA, and I've not
            perfected AGC-to-AGS communication yet.<br>

        the binary installation, they'll still be the files *.s, but the
        easiest way to find the name of the directory they're in is to
        "Browse Source Code" from within the <span style="font-weight:

        directory is being referenced by the browser.) <br>

      <li>You should now see the DSKY doing whatever you've programmed
        it to do.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>On the chance that your program may not do what you expected

      (for the advanced student) </h3>
    Prior to the descent of Apollo 14's LM to the lunar surface, a short
    in the LM control panel caused the abort switch to be triggered
    intermittently.&nbsp; If this actually happened during the landing,
    an abort would have automatically occurred (meaning that the lower
    stage of the LM would have been jettisoned and the upper stage would
    have blasted back into space).&nbsp; No landing would have been
    possible, and the astronauts would have faced the grave situation of
    needing rescue by the command module.&nbsp; It was therefore
    necessary, in the orbit or two before descent, for the some of the
    software designers to work out a fix for this problem that allowed a
    software lockout of the abort switch during the initial phase of the
    descent, but also allowed reenabling the abort switch later in the
    descent, in case the astronauts needed to use it.&nbsp; They did, in
    fact, work out such a fix.&nbsp; Your mission, should you choose to
    accept it, is this:&nbsp; Work out such a fix and send it to
    me.&nbsp; Remember, your fix can only involve erasable memory, since
    the core-rope containing the program cannot be altered.&nbsp; The
    fix needs to be keyed in at the DSKY by the astronauts.&nbsp; You
    have about 90 minutes to figure it out.&nbsp; Go!<br>

      mood </h3>
    Use Virtual AGC as a clock for your PC desktop.&nbsp; (My word, this
    software is versatile!)&nbsp; I'd suggest using the "DSKY Type" of
    "Half-size" for this.&nbsp; Use the <a href="#MonitorTime">instructions

      given above</a> for setting and monitoring the time.&nbsp; You'll
    have to reset the time very morning, because the "hours" will not
    wrap around to 0 after 24.&nbsp; (And besides, the timers will
    overflow after 2<sup>28</sup>/100 seconds, or just over 31 days.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint:</span>&nbsp; Once you get
    this working well, you'll want to be able to start this up
    automatically, and not have to run <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    every time.&nbsp; Well, when <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    runs the simulation, it does so by creating batch files (in Windows)
    or a shell script (in Linux or Mac OS X), then simply running those
    batch files or shell scripts.&nbsp; When you run a custom program in
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, you use the
    "More" button in the simulation window to show you the contents of
    those batch files or shell scripts.&nbsp; So you can reuse or adapt
    those files for starting up your own simulation.<br>

    Write your own AGC or AEA assembly language program for a

        It should go without saying that by singling out coders, I don't
        mean to imply that hardware design, system architecture, or even
        program management is not important.&nbsp; The AGC hardware was
        certainly pretty revolutionary for its time, in terms of
        miniaturization and reliability.&nbsp; A <span
          style="font-style: italic;">complete</span> AGC honor roll
        would need to include names like Charles Stark Draper and many
        others.&nbsp; But since our simulation of necessity concentrates
        on the software aspects of the AGC over the hardware aspects,
        the software developers are the ones particularly being honored
        here.</li>
      <li>I don't want to forget the original developers of the AGS
        software either, but I don't yet know any of your names!<br>

        source code.&nbsp; Without those I wouldn't even have attempted

    <h2><a name="Solution_to_the_Apollo_14_Final_Exam"></a>Solution to
      the Apollo 14 "Final Exam" Problem</h2>
    Above, we semi-jokingly proposed as a <a
      href="#Final_exam_for_the_advanced_student_">"final exam" problem
    </a>a situation which actually occurred during Alan Shepard and
    Edgar Mitchell's attempt to land the LM during the Apollo 14
    mission.&nbsp; <a
      href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14AbortDiscrete.html">Paul
      Fjeld has provided a lot of detail about this at the Apollo Lunar
      Surface Journal</a>, by consulting mission transcripts.&nbsp; Our
    Onno Hommes has also gotten an explanation directly from Don Eyles,
    the AGC developer who solved the final exam problem in real time
    during the mission and, as far as I know, the only AGC coder ever to
    be dramatized (in the Apollo 14 episode of <span style="font-style:
      italic;">From the Earth to the Moon</span>).&nbsp; And <a
      href="http://www.doneyles.com/LM/Tales.html">Don has written about
      it himself</a> (among many other stories) pretty interestingly, in
    a fairly popularized way. &nbsp; But here's the detailed solution,
    in as nearly Don's words as we can make it:<br>
    <br>
    <table style="text-align: left; width: 75%; margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(204,
            204, 204);">The procedure developed to work around the
            erroneous abort signal on Apollo 14 was as follows:<br>
            <br>
            (1) After the NOUN 62 countdown starts (an automatic display
            of the countdown toward engine ignition), but before
            ignition, key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">VERB 21 NOUN 1 ENTER 1010
              ENTER <br>
              107 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            to set the mode register to 71 to indicate that an abort had
            already occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the numbers are in
            "octal" (i.e. based on the root of 8 not 10) so that the
            number "107" actually means "71".<br>
            <br>
            (2) Exactly 26 seconds after ignition, manually advance the
            descent engine throttle to 100%.<br>
            <br>
            (3) Key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER 101
              ENTER <br>
              200 ENTER 1 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            to enable the landing guidance equations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
            equations were prevented from starting automatically because
            the mode register is set to the phony value of 71.<br>
            <br>
            (4) Key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">VERB 25 NOUN 7 ENTER 105
              ENTER <br>
              400 ENTER 0 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            to explicitly disable the abort monitor. This clears the <span
              class="e">FLAGWORD</span> bit that controls the abort
            monitor.<br>
            <br>
            (5) Key in<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">VERB 21 NOUN 1 ENTER 1010
              ENTER <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            to set the mode register to its proper value of 63.<br>
            <br>
            (6) Return the manual throttle to its minimum
            setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The throttle stays at 100% because it is
